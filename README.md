# tcp1

Example tcp client and server.
Sample code is provided (TcpClient.java and TcpServer.java)in which 
the user will type a sentence into the client and the server will 
return a capitalized version.  The client exits after receiving
the response from the server

The assignment is to create new versions (TcpClient2.java and TcpServer2.java)
in which the client accepts a second sentence from the user and exits 
after receiving the capitalized version of the second sentence from the server.
